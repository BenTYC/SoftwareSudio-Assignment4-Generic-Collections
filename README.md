# Software Studio Assignment 4 - Generic Collections

We've implemented a simple data structure framework, which is also the solution to assignment 3.

Please make the framework generic.

## Requirements
To make the framework generic, you'll need to:

1. Redesign all of the interfaces.

2. Modify related implementations.

## Hints
1. You may consult the API package `java.util.*`.
2. You should make inner classes (such as `Entry`) generic too.

## Submission

The procedure of submission is as following:

1. Fork our [template repository][1] on GitLab.
2. Clone the repository you forked.
3. Finish your work, run test cases to check if your implementation meets the requirements.
4. Commit your work, push to GitLab and then open a merge request to submit.

Note:

- Don't forget to add files to index before commiting.
- To submit a newer version after opening a merge request, simply push again.

Please refer to the lab slides: [Version Control & Debugger][2] for a complete tutorial.



## Deadline

Sumbit your work before **2016/4/13 (Wed.) 23:59:59**.

Late submissions **WILL NOT** be accepted.
